                    <p> The Hypertext Markup Language(HTML) is one of the two core technologies used for web developing, developed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1990 after having wrote the browser and server software. From HTML 1.0, the Hypertext Markup Language has had many updates and improved versions throughout the past decade. </p>

                        <p><b>HTML 1.0</b> - The very first release of the Hypertext Markup Language.</p>
                        <p><b>HTML 2.0</b> - HTML 2.0 was the expansion of the Hypertext Markup Language. In relation to the first HTML version released, and was created for the means of being a Web Standard. It was necessary to have a strict set of standards that outlined what the HTML was capable of doing for the developer. This information became available in the development of HTML 2.0, and at the time of its release, it was the source accessible for users to learn exactly how the language worked. HTML 2.0 published as<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1866"> IETF RFC 1866</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>HTML 3.0</b> - intended to be a proposal for the extension of the Hypertext Markup Language, however, the difference of HTML 2.0 and HTML 3.0 was apparently so large that the deployment and standardization of the language became too difficult to manage. Thus, it is no longer being maintained.</p>
                        <p><b>HTML 3.2</b> - (W3C Recommendation, Jan 1997) Relative to HTML 2.0, this HTML version deploys features such as the tables, applets, image text flow, superscript, and subscript.</p>
                        <p><b>HTML 4.0</b> - (W3C Recommendation, Dec 1999) According to the World Wide Web Consortium, HTML 4 is a Standard Generalized Markup Language application that is widely regarded as the standard publishing language of the World Wide Web. It has remained stable since the 1980s in regards to the fact that this markup language is both feature-rich and is flexible.<br/>
                        <b>Differences with HTML 4</b>
                            <ol>
                            <li>Documents must be well-formed. This essentially means that all elements must have closing tags, or at least be enclosed in a special tag.</li>
                            <br/>
                            <li>Element and attribute names must be in lower case. </li>
                            <br/>
                            <li>End tags are required for non-void elements.</li>
                            <br/>
                            <li>Attribute values must always be quoted, even for numerical elements. </li>
                            <br/>
                            <li>Attribute-value pairs must be written in full.</li>
                            <br/>
                            <li>Void elements should also have an end tag.</li>
                            <br/>
                            <li>One or more white-space characters must be mapped to a single inter-word space</li> 
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <p><b>XHTML 1.0</b> - XHTML is a family of current document types, as well as future document types and modules that reproduce, subset, and extend HTML 4. Its family document types are XML-based, and are ultimately designed to work in relation to XML-based users. Web developers who migrate their content to XHTML would fall under these benefits:
                        </p>
                        <p><b>HTML5</b> Rather than a replacement for the previous version, HTML5 serves as the evolutionary version of HTML 4, as it consists of similar characteristics, elements and the like, only with more added features for developers to utilize.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>HTML PREPROCESSORS</b> -Preprocessors are programs that convert a type of data to another type of data. A lot of HTML data and content may require you to enter the repeated data time and time again, and this may prove to be time-consuming and inefficient. As such, preprocessors exist to ease the developing of HTML documents, where many contain redundant information that in turn will have to be managed. As to the basics, HTML preprocessors are classified into 3 classes:
                        <ol>
                        <li>XHTML documents can be readily viewed, edited, and validating via XML tools. </li></br>
                        <li>XHTML documents may be written to operate as in HTML 4, or better. </li></br>
                        <li>XHTML documents can utilize script applications and other applets that rely on either HTML Document Object Model or the XML Document Object Model.</li>
                        </ol>
                        </p>
