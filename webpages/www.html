        <p>The following are aids to the data transfer of the World Wide Web:
        <br><br>
        <b>URL</b> - Its URL serves to provide or address the web resources that are available.
        <br><br>
        <b>IP Address</b> - It is the numerival value associated with a certain device or machine, and is needed for accessibility
        </p>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Prior to the World Wide Web, there were also other systems that could function as did the World Wide Web. One of these was:
        <br>
        <b>Gopher</b> - It is a menu-based protocolwhere web resources were text-based, and images, videos, etc. were unavailable
